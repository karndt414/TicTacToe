# 5×5 Multiplayer Game (TicTacToe repo)

A simple, modern 5×5 board game built with **React + TypeScript**, styled with **TailwindCSS**, and using components from **shadcn/ui**. This repository contains a clean, interactive grid-based front-end and the basic game logic for a 5×5 X/O-style game ready to be extended with multiplayer connectivity or AI.

> Note: This README was created from the project's existing README and observed stack (React, TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui). For exact instructions tailored to your `package.json` and folder layout, I can re-check the repo or you can paste those files here. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+ recommended)  
- npm or yarn or pnpm

### Install & run locally

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/karndt414/TicTacToe.git
cd TicTacToe/my-game

# install (choose one)
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install

# dev server
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev

Open your browser at the port the dev server prints (commonly http://localhost:5173 for Vite).
Build for production

npm run build
# or yarn build
# or pnpm build

Lint / Format / Tests

(If present — update commands to match the repo)

npm run lint
npm run format
npm run test

How the game works (high level)

    The board is represented as a 5×5 array of cells in state.

    Players click on empty cells to place their mark (X or O).

    After each move the board is evaluated for a winner:

        You can configure winning rules (3-in-a-row, 4-in-a-row, or 5-in-a-row).

    If a winner is detected, the game stops and displays the result.

    If the board fills with no winner, the game ends in a draw.

    Controls include: new game / reset, toggle first player, (optional) undo.

Ready for multiplayer or AI

This repo is structured to be extended:

    Add a simple WebSocket or WebRTC layer for real-time multiplayer.

    Add a server-side matchmaker (Node.js + Socket.io) or use Firebase Realtime/Firestore for sync.

    Implement AI (minimax for smaller boards; heuristics for larger boards) for single-player mode.

Possible improvements

    Add automated tests for win/draw logic (important for 5×5 rules).

    Add animations and accessible keyboard controls.

    Support different board sizes (n×n) and configurable win-length.

    Add persistent game history / localStorage save.

    Add multiplayer lobby, matchmaking, spectator mode.

Notes about this README

I used the repo's visible README and metadata to infer tech and features. I could not load or inspect each source file fully from the browsing tool in this session — if you want a README that references exact scripts (e.g. exact npm run commands from your package.json) or lists component names/props from the source, either:

    let me re-open the repo so I can read package.json and src/ (I’ll update the README using those exact commands and filenames), OR

    paste the package.json and the src/ folder tree / key component file(s) here, and I’ll produce a 1:1 tailored README.

Which would you prefer? (If you want, paste package.json and I’ll immediately produce a final README using the exact scripts and dependencies.)

If you want, I can immediately paste the final README into the repo as a commit — or produce a pull request — if you give me repo access or provide a personal access token.

🧮 How the Game Works

    Board is stored as a 5×5 state array.

    Players alternate clicking empty cells to place X or O.

    After each move:

        Game checks for a win condition (row, column, or diagonal).

        If board is full without a winner → declare a draw.

        Otherwise → switch to the next player.

    Reset button clears the board and state for a new game.

✨ Future Improvements

    AI Opponent (minimax or heuristic-based for 5×5)

    Multiplayer support via WebSockets, WebRTC, or Firebase

    Variable board sizes (3×3, 4×4, 6×6, etc.)

    Game history & undo/redo

    Animations & accessibility improvements

    Unit tests for win/draw logic
